<h1> I made a sourdough starter two weeks ago </h1>
<p> My boss had one at work and I got jealous. Also, I was thinking about the episode of Brooklyn 99 where Boyle is fighting someone over a starter that's been in his family for ages and I liked the committment <br>
I thought that could be my legacy-- 'aw, yeah, my great-great-grandma made this when she was 16, and I've been making the ancient manna ever since' except my grandkid is, like, floating and communicating with their assigned AI friend telepathically<br>
(Additionally, I fuckin luv sourdough)<br>
So I stole one of Mum's jars she uses for pickling beetroot, and inserted some bread ingredients<br>
It was pretty easy, but then I got lazy. There's nothing to be lazy about, really-- take out some fermented muck, put in stuff for production of new fermented muck--<br>
But I managed.<br>
This morning, I was making muffins for Mum, and she reminded me about the festering mess next to the stove<br>
When I opened it, she made me take it outside, because it actually smelled like a corpse-- and she'd complained about the normal, alive-bacteria smell too!<br>
No, this shit was revolting. <br>
I fed it, finally. You're supposed to give it a name, but I feel no emotional attachment to this thing. Yeah, I starved it for a week. I'm a really abusive parent. Maybe I should hold off on the kids thing for a while, let alone thinkin about my robot great-great-grandkids
