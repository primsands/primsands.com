So today we got pulled out of our Pastoral Care (imparsable term) classes to listen to a speech but we ended up having to draw shapes on each others backs or whatever<br>
  Like Chinese Whispers but tactile<br>
  Anyway the original was a boat and a sun and one of those birds that is actually a curvy line<br>
  So the stupid convoluted way that was chosen to link this and 'get good ATAR please' was to ask us what our 'yacht blockers' were-- ergo, the things preventing us from doing well<br>
  First off, that boat was not a yacht. It was little and it had a sail. It was a sailboat like Iggle-mofo-Piggle's<br>
  I think my yacht blockers are myself. Like literally I did this assignment... I'm probably at fault for whatever grade I get...............<br>
  So then I went to class after that and we got our exams back and I scored full so take that. I learned nothing dumdum<br>
  In other news we got our new debate topic: 'That Australia should boycott China‚Äôs 2022 Winter Olympics'-- and have to argue negative<br>
  I was proper distraught at first but I've realised there's more evidence to support our assigned viewpoint than any other, which end up pretty simplistic and 'genocide bad!' anyway<br>
  Maybe I'll edit it into an essay after we're done, post it here; I've actual convinced myself of this<br>
  I think this topic is different, though, because it's contested in the Senate as I type this. Uyghurs are being sterilised and incarcerated and reeducated <em>as I type this</em><br>
  So yeah it's got a bit more weight to it. Scary<br>
  After that I had a driving lesson and the instructor kept gettin up me for changing gears violently but the way he did it was by asking why I 'wasn't more gentle, [you're] a young lady' which is... iffy<br>
  Like I get he's old but c'mon<br>
  Actually I've changed my mind. This website is deffo a yacht blocker</p><br>
  <p style="font-size:5px; font-family:Arial;">I'd really like Albo to be PM</p><br>
  <p style="font-family:Arial;"> Good night</p>
