They suck!<br>
The 309 drove off early so I kinda stood around and then waited for the 166<br>
Anyway. I forgot that the 166 is hot as balls and full of <em> Mercy kids</em><br>
I hate those mfs!<br>
All they do is play shit music and strap kids to the ceiling with their belts little fuckin gronks<br>
Happy ending through. I'm writing this on my phone on the 309<br>
Conversely, though, I didn't know you could get blisters on the bottom of your feet‚Äî as in, not in the bit where your thongs intersect your toes‚Äî until today. I've elected to not walk 4km in formal shoes ever again
