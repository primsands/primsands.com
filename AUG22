Lately I've been getting really into libgen.li and scihub.wf for awesome reasons<br>
So I've read heaps of books instead of doing my work, they download themselves as pdfs and epub files and it's cool as <br>
Here's a list but not in order:<br>
<ul><li>Memoirs of a Geisha</li>
<li>The Jakarta Method (fave)</li>
<li>River Town</li>
<li>Without You, There Is No Us</li>
</ul>
I also got stuff out from the library but it's all returned now so I can't tell you anything. You can tell a little bit that I'm ideologically opposed to fiction coz lately it's gotten really boring and annoying. Like as a genre. Why would you make stuff up when there's so many people and things happening already? Why would you lie for fun?<br>
Speaking of lying for fun, it's Achazia's birthday today, and she's been going around telling everyone it's tomorrow. She also told me that she built the Bruce Highway, and she's not actually from the Philippines<br>
So we went to her new house on the weekend, and sat around and watched movies and walked to get sushi, which was good because I got $3.50 miso soup with no tofu, which actually isn't really good now I think about it, we got fully scammed. Joey and Mandy and I all slept in one bed, but not before we spent two hours laying awake and talking about linguistics and cultural studies. Cathleen slept on the couch, but not before she stood at the foot of our bed in the dark with tongs that she just washed and threatened to tong us. Achazia passed out in another bedroom with the lights on, as if we didn't need confirmation she's insane<br>
Klara left on Saturday, which I'm sad about because she's so sweet. It doesn't feel like it's been six weeks already. But it also got me thinking about how she only fit in so well and I found it so easy to talk to her because she's also a rich white girl from a first world country, even if our first world country languages aren't exactly the same<br>
The consequences of not writing anything on here for ages are I have a lot to write about. The weekend before last we went to the Filipino cafe in the Northern Beaches (it's crazy up there, like a whole another city), and the adobo I ate was really fatty and I regretted it later. After that, we were on our way to the Troppo markets at Mount P when we stopped at the roadside market next to the golf course, and got some fruit, and the fella there told me all about how people in Rocky and Australia in general are really racist, which I just kind of politely agreed with. But when we were leaving, he gestured to us all and said something about cross-cultural friendships, then said 'But Australians can't have friends, remember that'. I'm not likening it to actual racism, but that was my first proper experience of being irrationally just othered by a stranger, even if he didn't say anything about me directly, and I really hated it. My friends have had to put up with so much worse than that their whole lives, which I guess I knew, and thought I sympathised with, but I never properly did I think <br>
Then we went to the markets and Mandy shouted us crystal pendants (I have rose quartz)<br>
Mum's gone to Rocky again to take Grandma to the doctors, so it's no nutritional value for the rest of the week<br>
In about a week, the deadline for early VTAC apps closes and I have to pay more, but I'm not sure if I want to submit them for a $44 app fee, honestly. ANU early offers come out really really really soon. I'm scared, and I've been spending a lot of money for no reason, and I feel fat and pale and ugly all the time. I want to go out running, but it's embarrassing; everyone'll see me, and I've got too much work to do, so I reckon I'll just sit at home and do nothing<br>
This arvo on the bus, the cranky bitch bus driver started getting up the Milton kids that get off at Dundula, telling them they should get on a bus that doesn't even go there, and since they're not stupid they told her and that made her crankier. I made sympathetic faces and me and some grade ten shared a meaningful look, I think, I dunno, I was reading River Town. <br>
Milton kids are way more polite and friendly than any private school kid. I wish I went to Sarina State, even if they don't have many subjects<br>
Ummmm other things<br>
Tayla got her Ps, we might go to Bowen for schoolies (still have to book), we're going as the Care Bears for our last Book Week. That involves Cotton On shirts and some crocheted ears on headbands. Mocks are coming up but I'm slack to do, like, anything. We took down heaps of blutack in the Japanese room the other day. Jodie from the hairdresser said hi to me as she got off the bus; she's really pretty. I wish I didn't eat so much for no reason. It's getting a little bit warmer again, but not enough to stop taking jumpers to school. I want to try and fix myself, but I keep myself stagnant as if that'll help me do schoolwork. I keep getting the sniffles. Spotify playlist recommendations have been shit lately. I don't have any real problems <br></p><p style="text-align:right; font-size:10px;"> <a href="index.html">üè†</a> / <a href="abt.html">ABT</a> / <a href="http://twitter.com/PR1MASE">TWT</a> / <a href="http://quizlet.com/primsands">QZLT</a>
