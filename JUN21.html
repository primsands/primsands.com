<p style="font-family:Arial;"> 
Shrooms don't even work<br>
  I took em in the exact middle of Bio but Mr Sm*th saw us walk out so he was a bit sussy. Actual I didn't peg him for a snitch I thought he supported women's rights<br>
  Nothing even happened. Sez couldn't feel their teeth whenever they drank water but that was literally it<br>
  Also Cathleen gave me a friendship bracelet today (all these little beads in rainbow blocks and then a big pearl-lookin one in the middle, very cute) and Barnaby Joyce came out on top in a Nats leadership spill (Mum texted me during Lit, extremely ominous)<br>
  I'm so bored and have so much homework<br>
  I spent last night culling my one Pinterest board and I really really really want to go to a second-hand shop and look for some of those touristy shirts for little kids. In addition heart tail lights<br>
  This is stupid. Maybe I'll proper trip at the Sarina Show. That'd be nice I think
