I wish I drove four hours to go to Beef Week and heckle all the Nationals MPs doin trade<br>
  I even packaged sugar cookies for my federal member at work yesterday so what's the point otherwise<br>
  Am currently watchin Matt Canavan deride the half-emissions by 2030 thing that Victorian government's just put forward, plastered in all the Beef merch, and Mum's almost hissing at the TV<br>
  Furthermore!<br>
  I tried one of those study stream videos today, which worked a little bit; I only got ten minutes into the last hour, though, and then decided study just wasn't necessary or normal or right<br>
  Didn't achieve much, either. Think I might stick to laying comatose and watching countryballs videos for all future weekends
