There's this old lady sitting in the seat below-in-front of me and her headscarf has those tacky little jewel things in squares all over the back<br>
And while they're kinda reflecting everywhere and incoherent I got reminded of the crafts I used to do at daycare<br>
I miss it. I can't get back there but if I could I'd take it<br>
Exams are over so maybe I can chase the Reject Shop embellishment high from now on
