Time flies!<br>
It's exactly a month until Joey's birthday<br>
Yesterday, I worked four hours, then drove to the Coconut Festival, then got bored and walked out along the weird little rocky peninsula on Campwin that only shows up at low tide, then home, where I made dinner.<br>
The coral is cleaning, and the beach is all grey sludge. Seeing live stuff is really weird<br>
They shouldn't even call it the Coral Sea anymore<br>
Today, I drove to Canelands, and didn't even crash! I was shaking like mad when I got out of the car, though. Might have been the two coffees<br>
Tayla and Cathleen were working at their separate Coffee Clubs, like rivals<br>
Dad got his glasses repaired, and I drove to Ooralea Woolies, and we both yelled at the self checkouts<br>
Mum rescued a little dove? bird? thing from the yard cos it was about to get eaten by a crow and now it sits on my hand no fuss. It's in a box in the laundry<br>
Before that I detoured through the salt flats and crashed Tayla's little second cousin's second birthday, and none of her first cousins were happy with me. Little kids are so fucken weird<br>
Enough! of the immediate past. We finished exams last Friday, and they were horrible. I left four questions blank on the Methods tech-active because they were about cubics and I hate cubics so I didn't study them. At least I didn't cry<br>
I studied everything else though! Maths is just not! for! me!<br>
Like not to be dramatic but if I get a 98 ATAR I think I'll kill myself out of disappointment.<br>
Even English betrayed me-- I waffled on about random shit and forgot to put a title, and in Japanese I didn't get asked the questions that I'd thought up high-mark sentences for, so I just kind of sat there silently (which you get marked down for!)<br>
Everything's going wrong. Prickles that stay in your feet are the worst ever<br>
And now we're doing actual ATAR work, things are going to get very rapidly worse. Holidays are just going to be work. I'm not looking forward to anything. I kind of hate my friends. I never get to go out and drink or smoke, and I'm a virgin because there's no such thing as a pretty gay girl with enough social distance and clout for it not to be awks, and I banked my whole reputation on being bitchy enough for people to leave me alone, and now that they do I'm lonely, and my parents never get off harassing me to brush my fucking teeth. I don't want to brush my teeth<br>
Whole time, I've been pushing through because I believe so earnestly that things are better on the other side of high school. What if high school's the better side, and I'm wasting it because no one likes me?<br>
I'm not stuck up. I just think you're fucking stupid. It's not my fault<br>
