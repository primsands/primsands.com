<p> Cooking is too complicated. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of making something and want to cry because I no longer want to do it and know it'll turn out tasteless anyway because the mummy blog I got the recipe off called for a teaspoon of salt and no more<br>
So here are the things that are so easy even I can do them.</p>

    <div class="inner3">
      01. Chop a shitload of <b>carrots</b> and <b>celery</b>-- usually I do three of each<br>
      02. Then you chop an <b>onion</b><br>
      03. Put heaps of olive oil in a big pot on medium heat and chuck in your veg<br>
      04. Stir them for like three minutes. When the onion's going translucent, put in<br>
      <ul><li>2 tsp ground cumin</li><li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li><li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li><li>2 tsp ground fennel</li><li>Some saffron if you have it</li><li>I lied about the amounts!</li><li>Put in what feels right</li></ul>
      05. Whatever you put in, now put in more. Once you've mixed it in and it smells really good, put in 2 tbsp tomato paste and a tin of tomatoes including their juice. Stir that<br>
      06. Drain a can of chickpeas, put that in. Any dried lentils in the house? Add a handful. Put in 750mL of veg stock<br>
      07. Boil, then simmer for 20 mins<br>
      08. While that's happening, chop up whatever green herbs you can find. Just go stupid with a big knife. Once the pot's finished, stir through that, minced garlic and minced ginger from jars. You're done. You will never ever taste a better soup

  <input type="checkbox" name="one" id="item-3">
  <div class="hide3">
    <div class="inner3">
      01. Chop half a head of Napa cabbage really fine (using the white bits is good)<br>
      02. Toss it in a bowl with 2 tsp of salt and let it sit on the bench for 15<br>
      03. Then chuck that in a clean teatowel, scrunch it like a wonton at the top, and squeeze the life outta it. Your sink should be full of cabbage juice<br>
      04. Chop your 3 fair-size spring onions fine and get them in a big bowl. Also your cabbage, which now looks like a really old Chux. Next, put in w/ them<br>
      <ul><li>500g pork mince but it doesn't matter that much</li><li>1 tsp pepper</li><li>Tbsp minced garlic</li><li>1 tsp minced ginger</li><li>2 tsp sugar</li><li>Idk some soy sauce?</li><li>Mirin and sesame oil as a treat? Only if you have it though</li><li>Seriously just put in anything you think is more than this don't measure stuff</li><li>Chives might be good if you have them otherwise don't bother</li></ul>
      05. Knead it all 2gether until homogenous<br>
      06. Get yourself a little bowl of water and a big plate and a packet or two of round dumpling wrappers which you can even get from Sarina Woolies in the fridge section so no one else should have problems sourcing them<br>
      07. Fold your dumplings and set them aside on your plate. If you can't do that, get good<br>
      08. Now, you can either boil them (fair, but low-reward) or fry them (proper, correct way)-- arrange them in rings inside your frypan with heaps of sesame oil over medium-high heat until they've got golden-brown bums, then put in half a cup of water and give them the lid. Once that's all evaporated, you have dumplings<br>
