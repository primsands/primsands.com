<p> Cooking is too complicated. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of making something and want to cry because I no longer want to do it and know it'll turn out tasteless anyway because the mummy blog I got the recipe off called for a teaspoon of salt and no more<br>
So here are the things that are so easy even I can do them.</p>

    <div class="inner3">
      01. Chop a shitload of carrots and celery-- usually I do three of each<br>
      02. Then you chop an onion<br>
      03. Put heaps of olive oil in a heavy-bottomed pot on medium heat and chuck in your veg<br>
      04. Stir them for like three minutes. When the onion's going translucent, put in<br>
      <ul><li>2 tsp ground cumin</li><li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li><li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li><li>2 tsp ground fennel</li><li>Some saffron if you have it</li><li>I lied about the amounts!</li><li>Put in what feels right</li></ul>
      05. Whatever you put in, now put in more. Once you've mixed it in and it smells really good, put in 2 tbsp tomato paste and a tin of tomatoes including their juice. Stir that
      06. Drain a can of chickpeas, put that in. Any dried lentils in the house? Add a handful. Put in 750mL of veg stock
      07. Boil, then simmer for 20 mins
      08. While that's happening, chop up whatever green herbs you can find. Just go stupid with a big knife. Once the pot's finished, stir through that, minced garlic and minced ginger from jars. You're done. You will never ever taste a better soup
